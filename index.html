      <h3><b>MARS</b></h3>
      <h5>Mars and the future of humanity , <span class="w3-opacity">November 29, 2018</span></h5>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>Mars is a small rocky body once thought to be very Earthlike. Like the other terrestrial planets—Mercury, Venus, and Earth—its surface has been changed by volcanism, impacts from other bodies, movements of its crust, and atmospheric effects such as dust storms. It has polar ice caps that grow and recede with the change of seasons; areas of layered soils near the Martian poles suggest that the planet's climate has changed more than once, perhaps caused by a regular change in the planet's orbit.</p>
      
      <p>At present, Mars is too cold and its atmosphere is too thin to allow liquid water to exist at the surface for long. There's water ice close to the surface and more water frozen in the polar ice caps, but the quantity of water required to carve Mars's great channels and flood plains is not evident on—or near—the surface today. Images from NASA's Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft suggest that underground reserves of water may break through the surface as springs. The answers may lie deep beneath Mars's red soil.</p>
      
       <p>Unraveling the story of water on Mars is important to unlocking its past climate history, which will help us understand the evolution of all planets, including our own. Water is also believed to be a central ingredient for the initiation of life; the evidence of past or present water on Mars is expected to hold clues about past or present life on Mars, as well as the potential for life elsewhere in the universe. And, before humans can safely go to Mars, we need to know much more about the planet's environment, including the availability of resources such as water.</p>
       
       <p>The current understanding of planetary habitability—the ability of a world to develop environmental conditions favorable to the emergence of life—favors planets that have liquid water on their surface. Most often this requires the orbit of a planet to lie within the habitable zone, which for the Sun extends from just beyond Venus to about the semi-major axis of Mars. During perihelion, Mars dips inside this region, but Mars's thin (low-pressure) atmosphere prevents liquid water from existing over large regions for extended periods. The past flow of liquid water demonstrates the planet's potential for habitability. Recent evidence has suggested that any water on the Martian surface may have been too salty and acidic to support regular terrestrial life.

The lack of a magnetosphere and the extremely thin atmosphere of Mars are a challenge: the planet has little heat transfer across its surface, poor insulation against bombardment of the solar wind and insufficient atmospheric pressure to retain water in a liquid form (water instead sublimes to a gaseous state). Mars is nearly, or perhaps totally, geologically dead; the end of volcanic activity has apparently stopped the recycling of chemicals and minerals between the surface and interior of the planet.

In situ investigations have been performed on Mars by the Viking landers, Spirit and Opportunity rovers, Phoenix lander, and Curiosity rover. Evidence suggests that the planet was once significantly more habitable than it is today, but whether living organisms ever existed there remains unknown. The Viking probes of the mid-1970s carried experiments designed to detect microorganisms in Martian soil at their respective landing sites and had positive results, including a temporary increase of CO2 production on exposure to water and nutrients. This sign of life was later disputed by scientists, resulting in a continuing debate, with NASA scientist Gilbert Levin asserting that Viking may have found life. A re-analysis of the Viking data, in light of modern knowledge of extremophile forms of life, has suggested that the Viking tests were not sophisticated enough to detect these forms of life. The tests could even have killed a (hypothetical) life form.[187] Tests conducted by the Phoenix Mars lander have shown that the soil has a alkaline pH and it contains magnesium, sodium, potassium and chloride. The soil nutrients may be able to support life, but life would still have to be shielded from the intense ultraviolet light. A recent analysis of martian meteorite EETA79001 found 0.6 ppm ClO−4, 1.4 ppm ClO−3, and 16 ppm NO−3, most likely of Martian origin. The ClO−3 suggests the presence of other highly oxidizing oxychlorines, such as ClO−2 or ClO, produced both by UV oxidation of Cl and X-ray radiolysis of ClO−Thus, only highly refractory and/or well-protected (sub-surface) organics or life forms are likely to survive.</p>

      <p>Science is involved in every aspect of our lives it is all around us from Biology, Chemistry, to Physics it help explain how and why things have specific outcomes. To some Science is magic to other Science is engineering, and to me Science is an adventure of discovery and explaination .</p>
      
      <p>Technology, the more it develops the more we can dream about the impossible. Year ago someone dreamed about a machine that can process an input and execute an output, then the computer developed into reality. Technology is now developing exponetially. Can wait to see the future of technology and its many contribution to make our lives easier.</p>
      
       <p>Engineering, some say innovation or inventing would be just a philosophy without engineers. Engieering is a difficult task but a well paid option. Engineering according to me is a really fun field regardless of the work needed to be one .</p>
       
        <p>Arts, is becoming more and more involved in STEM fields as it is directly connected to development of more and more innovative technology, and its direct connections to creativity and thinking outside the box for solutions.</p>
        
         <p>Mathematics is the study of such topics as quantity, structure, space, and change. It has no generally accepted definition. Mathematicians seek out patterns and use them to formulate new conjectures. Math is basically the langauge of the universe! since everthing can be expressed through variables and its modifications</p>

      <h3><b>Nikola Tesla</b></h3>
      <h5>The inventor of the AC generator concept and Tesla's coils , <span class="w3-opacity">June 6, 2018</span></h5>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>Image a world with no electricity, can you? </p>
      <p>Everday the flow of charges control almost every aspect of our lives. From yous cell phone to a simple light bulb.</p>
      <p>So if electrical energy is so significant then where does it come from and what concept does it follow. The energy is converted from some energy form such as kinetic energy from rushing water or wind pattern the does work on a turbine generator.</p>
      <p>But not just any generator. This generator is an Alternating Current generator which means the flow of electrons move in a back and forth manner. The inventor of the alternating current generator was Nikola Tesla in 1886 - Nikola Tesla tried to sell his AC power generator system to investors in New York City, but it fails to be of interest in a city which is already heavily invested in Edison's DC power systems. Other inventors around the world also promoting AC power have similar problems. But eventually the concept of the AC generator was proven to be the most efficient way of transmitting electricty over a large distances.</p>
      <p>Tesla Coils, imagine being able to charge you phone and using it without a charger or a powerbank. Using Tesla coils this is a possibility. His invention of an method of transmitting current wireless would have become an efficient technology application. But the concept was proven to be dangerous if too much voltage is passed through the coils.</p>
      <p>This has been my brief blog on Nikola Tesla. I did this blog to honour a genius inventor who's main intentions was to help people. I also feel that I embody some of the character traits as Tesla, such as an interest to help for the benefit rather than watch the chaos. I also aspire to learn about learning about new efficient way to generate electricity, and transmission with cheap costs for various developing countries</p>
